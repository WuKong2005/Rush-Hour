RUSH HOUR SEARCH ALGORITHM SIMULATOR - USER GUIDE

=== OVERVIEW ===
This application simulates various search algorithms on Rush Hour puzzles. 
Navigate through different maps and algorithms to compare their performance.

=== BASIC CONTROLS ===
H - Help (available at any time)
Enter - Switch to next map
Space - Enter algorithm selection mode / Start algorithm
= - Switch between algorithms (after pressing Space once)
Esc - Return to map selection

=== GETTING STARTED ===
1. Launch the application
2. Browse available maps using Enter key
3. When you find a map you want to test:
   - Press Space once to enter algorithm selection
   - Use = key to cycle through available algorithms
   - Press Space again to start the search

=== ALGORITHM EXECUTION ===
- After pressing Space, the program begins finding a solution
- Wait for the algorithm to complete (time varies by complexity)
- Results will show:
  * Whether a solution exists
  * Number of steps required (if solved)
  * Time elapsed during search

=== SOLUTION REVIEW ===
When algorithm completes:
S - Start solution animation
Esc - Return to map/algorithm selection

=== ANIMATION CONTROLS ===
Default: Automatic playback of solution steps
P - Pause animation and enter manual control mode

Manual Control Mode:
→ (Right Arrow) - Next step
← (Left Arrow) - Previous step
R - Restart to original puzzle state
Esc - Exit animation

=== TIPS ===
- Compare different algorithms on the same map
- Note performance differences between BFS, DFS, A*, etc.
- Use manual animation control to understand solution steps
- Press H anytime if you need help"""
